2,Irene Cara,Flashdance... What a Feeling,1983,"First when there's nothing
But a slow glowing dream
That your fear seems to hide
Deep inside your mind

All alone, I have cried
Silent tears full of pride
In a world made of steel
Made of stone

Well, I hear the music
Close my eyes, feel the rhythm
Wrap around, take a hold of my heart

What a feeling
Being's believing
I can have it all
Now I'm dancing for my life
Take your passion
And make it happen
Pictures come alive
You can dance right through your life

Now I hear the music
Close my eyes, I am rhythm
In a flash, it takes hold of my heart

What a feeling, being's believing
I can have it all
Now I'm dancing for my life
Take your passion
And make it happen
Pictures come alive
Now I'm dancing through my life

What a feeling

What a feeling (I am music now)
Being's believing (I am rhythm now)
Pictures come alive
You can dance right through your life

What a feeling (I can really have it all)
Being's believing
(Pictures come alive when I call)
I can have it all (I can really have it all)
Have it all (pictures come alive when I call)
(Call, call, call, call, what a feeling)
I can have it all (being's believing)
Being's believing (take your passion)"

Since you've gone I been lost without a trace
I dream at night I can only see your face
I look around but it's you I can't replace
I feel so cold and I long for your embrace

I keep crying baby, baby, please

Oh can't you see

How my poor heart aches
With every step you take

Every move you make

We Are The World
Written by Michael Jackson and Lionel Richie

There comes a time when we heed a certain call
When the world must come together as one
There are people dying
And it's time to lend a hand to life,
The greatest gift of all

We can go on pretending day by day
That someone, somewhere will soon make a change
We are all a part of God's great big family
And the truth you know love is all wee need

We are the world
We are the children
We are the ones who make a brighter day
So let's start giving
There's a choice we're making
We're saving our own lives
It's true we'll make a better day
Just you and me


Send them your heart so they'll know that someone cares
And their lives will be stronger and free
As God has shown us by turning stones to bread
So we all must lend a helping hand

We are the world
We are the children
We are the ones who make a brighter day
So let's start giving
There's a choice we're making
We're saving our own lives
It's true we'll make a better day
Just you and me

When you're down and out
There seems no hope at all
But if you just believe there's no way we can fall
Let us realize that a change can only come
When we stand together as one

We are the world
We are the children
We are the ones who make a brighter day
So let's start giving
There's a choice we're making
We're saving our own lives
It's true we'll make a better day
Just you and me

7,Survivor,Eye of the Tiger,1982,"Rising up, back on the street
Did my time, took my chances
Went the distance, now I'm back on my feet
Just a man and his will to survive
So many times it happens too fast
You change your passion for glory
Don't lose your grip on the dreams of the past
You must fight just to keep them alive

It's the eye of the tiger
It's the thrill of the fight
Rising up to the challenge of our rival
And the last known survivor
Stalks his prey in the night
And he's watching us all with the eye of the tiger

Face to face, out in the heat
Hanging tough, staying hungry
They stack the odds 'til we take to the street
For the kill with the skill to survive

It's the eye of the tiger
It's the thrill of the fight
Rising up to the challenge of our rival
And the last known survivor
Stalks his prey in the night
And he's watching us all with the eye of the tiger

Rising up straight to the top
Had the guts, got the glory
Went the distance, now I'm not going to stop
Just a man and his will to survive

It's the eye of the tiger
It's the thrill of the fight
Rising up to the challenge of our rival
And the last known survivor
Stalks his prey in the night
And he's watching us all with the eye of the tiger
The eye of the tiger

The eye of the tiger

8,Stevie Wonder,I Just Called to Say I Love You,1984,"No new years's day to celebrate
No chocolate covered candy hearts to give away
No first of spring, no song to sing
In fact here's just another ordinary day

No April rain, no flowers bloom
No wedding Saturday within the month of June
But what it is, is something true
Made up of these three words that I must say to you

I just called to say I love you
I just called to say how much I care
I just called to say I love you
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart

No summer's high, no warm July
No harvest moon to light one tender August night
No autumn breeze, no falling leaves
Not even time for birds to fly to southern skies

No Libra sun, no halloween
No giving thanks to all the Christmas joy you bring
But what it is, though old so new
To fill your heart like no three words could ever do

I just called to say I love you
I just called to say how much I care
I just called to say I love you
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart

I just called to say I love you
I just called to say how much I care
I just called to say I love you
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart

Of my heart
Of my heart"
9,George Michael,Careless Whisper,1984,"I feel so unsure
As I take your hand and lead you to the dance floor
As the music dies something in your eyes
Calls to mind a silver screen and all its sad goodbyes

I'm never gonna dance again
Guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it's easy to pretend
I know you're not a fool

I should have known better than to cheat a friend
And waste a chance that I'd been given
So I'm never gonna dance again
The way I danced with you

Time can never mend
The careless whispers of a good friend
To the heart and mind ignorance is kind
There's no comfort in the truth, pain is that all you'll find

I'm never gonna dance again
Guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it's easy to pretend
I know you're not a fool

I should have known better than to cheat a friend
And waste a chance that I'd been given
So I'm never gonna dance again
The way I danced with you

With or without your love

Tonight the music seems so loud
I wish that we could lose this crowd
Maybe it's better this way
We'd hurt each other with the things we want to say

We could have been so good together
We could have lived this dance forever
But now, who's gonna dance with me?
Please stay

I'm never gonna dance again
Guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it's easy to pretend
I know you're not a fool

I should have known better than to cheat a friend
And waste a chance that I'd been given
So I'm never gonna dance again
The way I danced with you

(Now that you're gone)
Now that you're gone

Was what I did so wrong?
So wrong that you had to leave me alone?"

A Woman In Love
Life is a moment in space 
When the dream is gone 
It’s a lonelier place 
I kiss the morning goodbye 
But down inside you know 
We never know why 
The road is narrow and long 
When eyes meet eyes 
And the feeling is strong 
I turn away from the wall 
I stumble and fall 
But I give you it all... 

Chorus: 
I am a woman in love 
And I do anything 
To get you into my world 
And hold you within 
It’s a right I defend 
Over and over again 
What do I do? 
With you eternally mine 
In love there is 
No measure of time 
We planned it all at the start 
That you and I 
Would live in each other's hearts 
We may be oceans away 
You feel my love 
I hear what you say 
No truth is ever a lie 
I stumble and fall 
But I give you it all 

Repeat Chorus 
I am a woman in love 
And I'm talking to you 
Do you know how it feels? 
What a woman can do 
It’s a right 
That I defend over and over again......"

We have grown, we have grown
Although our love is still special
Let's take a chance and fly away somewhere alone

It's been too long since we took the time
No-one's to blame, I know time flies so quickly
But when I see you darling
It's like we both are falling in love again
It'll be just like starting over, starting over

Everyday we used to make it love
Why can't we be making love nice and easy
It's time to spread our wings and fly
Don't let another day go by my love
It'll be just like starting over, starting over

Why don't we take off alone?
Take a trip somewhere far, far away
We'll be together all alone again
Like we used to in the early days
Well, well, well darling

It's been too long since we took the time
No-one's to blame, I know time flies so quickly
But when I see you darling
It's like we both are falling in love again

Of you and I engaged in a kiss
The sweat of your body covers me
Can you my darling, can you picture this?

Dream if you can a courtyard
An ocean of violets in bloom
Animals strike curious poses
They feel the heat, the heat between me and you

How can you just leave me standing
Alone in a world that's so cold?
Maybe I'm just too demanding
Maybe I'm just like my father, too bold

Maybe you're just like my mother
She's never satisfied
Why do we scream at each other?
This is what it sounds like when the doves cry

Touch if you will, my stomach
Feel how it trembles inside
You've got the butterflies all tied up
Don't make me chase you, even doves have pride

How can you just leave me standing

Still anticipating love
Never hesitating
To become the fated ones
Turning and returning
To some secret place inside

Through the hourglass i saw you

in time you slipped away
When the mirror crashed i called you
And turned to hear you say
If only for today
I am afraid
Take my breath away

33,Tina Turner,What's Love Got to Do With It?,1984,"You must understand
That the touch of your hand
Makes my pulse react
That it's only that thrill
Of boy meeting girl
Opposites attract
It's physical
Only logical
You must try to ignore
That it means more than that

Oh whats love got to do with it
What's love but a second hand emotion
What's love got to do with it
Who needs a heart
When a heart can be broken

It may seem to you
That I'm acting confused
When you're close to me
If I tend to look dazed
I've read it someplace
I've got cause to be
There's a name for it
There's a phrase for it
But whatever the reason
You do it for me

Oh whats love got to do with it
What's love but a second hand emotion
What's love got to do with it
Who needs a heart
When a heart can be broken

I've been taking on a new direction
But I have to say
I've been thinking about my own protection
It scares me to feel this way

What's love got to do, got do with it
What's love but a sweet old fashioned notion
What's love got to do, got to do with it
Who needs a heart when a heart can be broken"
34,Band Aid,Do They Know It's Christmas?,1984,"It's Christmas time
There's no need to be afraid
At Christmas time
We let in light and we banish shade

And in our world of plenty
We can spread a smile of joy
Throw your arms around the world
At Christmas time

But say a prayer
Pray for the other ones
At Christmas time, it's hard
But when you're having fun

There's a world outside your window
And it's a world of dreaded fear
Where the only water flowing
Is a bitter sting of tears

And the Christmas bells that ring there
Are the clanging chimes of doom
We'll, tonight, thank God, it's them
Instead of you

And there won't be snow in Africa this Christmas time
The greatest gift they'll get this year is life
Where nothing ever grows, no rain or rivers flow
Do they know it's Christmas time at all?

Here's to you
Raise your glass for everyone
Here's to them
Underneath that burning sun
Do they know it's Christmas time at all?

Feed the world

And in return you gave them hell
As cold as ice
I hope we live to tell the tale
I hope we live to...

Let it all out
These are the things I can do without
Come on
I'm talking to you
Come on

And when you've taken down your guard
If I could change your mind
I'd really love to break your heart
I'd really love to...

There's no way we could disguise it
Secretly
So we take each other's hand

The urgency just remember

You're the one thing
I can't get enough of
So I'll tell you something

No I never felt this way before
Yes I swear it's the truth
And I owe it all to you

With my body and soul
I want you more than you'll ever know
So we'll just let it go
Don't be afraid to lose control, no
Yes I know what's on your mind
When you say ""Stay with me
Tonight."" Just remember

You're the one thing
I can't get enough of
So I'll tell you something
This could be love because

55,Men At Work,Down Under,1982,"Traveling in a fried-out Kombi
On a hippie trail, head full of zombie
I met a strange lady, she made me nervous
She took me in and gave me breakfast
And she said

""Do you come from a land down under?
Where women glow and men plunder?
Can't you hear, can't you hear the thunder?
You better run, you better take cover""

Buying bread from a man in Brussels
He was six foot four and full of muscles
I said, ""Do you speak-a my language?""
He just smiled and gave me a Vegemite sandwich
And he said

""I come from a land down under
Where beer does flow and men sunder
Can't you hear, can't you hear the thunder?
You better run, you better take cover""

Lying in a den in Bombay
With a slack jaw and not much to say
I said to the man, ""Are you trying to tempt me
Because I come from the land of plenty?""
And he said

""Oh! do you come from a land down under?
Where women glow and men plunder?
Can't you hear, can't you hear the thunder?
You better run, you better take cover""

Living in a land down under
Where women glow and men plunder
Can't you hear, can't you hear the thunder?

Tainted Love
Sometimes I feel I've got to. . . run away,
I've got to. . . get away
>From the pain you drive into the heart of me.
The love we share seems to go nowhere,
And I've lost my life,
For I toss and turn; I can't sleep at night.

Chorus:
Once I ran to you, now I run from you.
This tainted love you've given,
I gave you all a boy could give you.
Take my tears and that's not really all. . .
Tainted love, ohh, tainted love

Now I know I've got to. . . run away,
I've got to. . . get away.
You don't really want any more from me.
To make things right you need someone to  hold you tight,
And you think love is to pray,
But I'm sorry I don't pray that way.

Chorus

Don't touch me please, I cannot stand the way you tease.
I love you though you hurt me so.
Now I'm gonna pack my things and go.

Ride super-high-tech jet fighters
Everyone's a Silverhero
Everyone's a Captain Kirk
With orders to identify
To clarify and classify
Scramble in the summer sky
As 99 red balloons go by

As 99 red balloons go by

99 dreams I have had
In every one a red balloon
It's all over and I'm standin' pretty
In this dust that was a city
If I could find a souvenier
Just to prove the world was here
And here is a red balloon
I think of you and let it go."

And the fever when I'm beside her

And tell you time and time again
How much I care
Sometimes I feel my heart will overflow
Hello!
I've just got to let you know
Because I wonder where you are
And I wonder what you do
Are you somewhere feeling lonely?
Or is someone loving you?
Tell me how to win your heart
For I haven't got a clue
But let me start by saying I love you

Help me to decide, help me make the most

Holding hands while the walls come tumbling down
When they do I'll be right behind you

So glad we've almost made it
So sad they had to fade it
Everybody wants to rule the world

I can't stand this indecision
Married with a lack of vision
Everybody wants to rule the world

Say that you'll never, never, never, never need it
One headline, why believe it?
Everybody wants to rule the world

All for freedom and for pleasure
Nothing ever lasts forever

90,Joe Cocker,Up Where We Belong,1982,"Who knows what tomorrow brings
In a world few hearts survive?
All I know is the way I feel
When it's real, I keep it alive

The road is long
There are mountains in our way
But we climb a step every day

Love lift us up where we belong
Where the eagles cry
On a mountain high

Love lift us up where we belong
Far from the world below
Up where the clear winds blow

Some hang on to, 'used to be'
Live their lives looking behind
All we have is here and now
All our life out there to find

The road is long
There are mountains in our way
But we climb a step every day

Love lift us up where we belong
Where the eagles cry
On a mountain high

Love lift us up where we belong
Far from the world we know
Where the clear wind blows

Time goes by, no time to cry
Life's you and I, a life today

Love lift us up where we belong
Where the eagles cry
On a mountain high

Love lift us up where we belong
Far from the world we know
Where the clear winds blow

Love lift us up where we belong
Where the eagles cry
On a mountain high
Love lift us up where we belong"
91,Dire Straits,Money For Nothing,1985,"Now look at them yo-yo's that's the way you do it
You play the guitar on the MTV
That ain't workin' that's the way you do it
Money for nothin' and chicks for free
Now that ain't workin' that's the way you do it
Lemme tell ya them guys ain't dumb
Maybe get a blister on your little finger
Maybe get a blister on your thumb

We gotta install microwave ovens
Custom kitchen deliveries
We gotta move these refrigerators
We gotta move these color TV's

See the little faggot with the earring and the make-up
Yeah buddy that's his own hair
That little faggot got his own jet airplane
That little faggot he's millionaire

We gotta install microwave ovens
Custom kitchen deliveries
We gotta move these refrigerators
We gotta move these color TV's

I shoulda' learned to play the guitar
I shoulda' learned to play them drums
Look at that mama, she got it stickin' in the camera
Man we could have some fun
And he's up there, what's that ? Hawaiian noises ?
Bangin' on the bongos like a chimpanzee
That ain't workin' that's the way you do it
Get your money for nothin' get your chicks for free

92,Abba,The Winner Takes it All,1980,"I don't wanna talk about the things we've gone through
Though it's hurting me, now it's history
I've played all my cards and that's what you've done too
Nothing more to say, no more ace to play

The winner takes it all, the loser standing small
Beside the victory that's her destiny

I was in your arms thinking I belonged there
I figured it made sense building me a fence
Building me a home thinking I'd be strong there
But I was a fool playing by the rules

The Gods may throw a dice, their minds as cold as ice
And someone way down here loses someone dear
The winner takes it all, the loser has to fall
It's simple and it's plain, why should I complain

But tell me does she kiss like I used to kiss you
Does it feel the same, when she calls your name
Somewhere deep inside you must know I miss you
But what can I say rules must be obeyed

The judges will decide, the likes of me abide
Spectators of the show always staying low
The game is on again, a lover or a friend
A big thing or a small the winner takes it all

I don't wanna talk if it makes you feel sad
And I understand you've come to shake my hand
I apologize if it makes you feel bad
Seeing me so tense, no self-confidence

But you see the winner takes it all
The winner takes it all
So the winner takes it all and the loser has to fall
Throw a dice, cold as ice
Way down here, someone dear
Takes it all, has to fall
Yes it's plain, no complain"
93,Chris de Burgh,The Lady in Red,1986,"I've never seen you looking so lovely as you did tonight
I've never seen you shine so bright
I've never seen so many men ask you if you wanted to dance
They're looking for a little romance, given half a chance
And I have never seen that dress you're wearing
Or the highlights in your hair that catch your eyes
I have been blind

The lady in red is dancing with me, cheek to cheek
There's nobody here, it's just you and me
It's where I want to be but I hardly know
This beauty by my side
I'll never forget the way you look tonight

I've never seen you looking so gorgeous as you did tonight
I've never seen you shine so bright, you were amazing
I've never seen so many people want to be there by your side
And when you turned to me and smiled, it took my breath away
And I have never had such a feeling
Such a feeling of complete and utter love, as I do tonight

The lady in red is dancing with me, cheek to cheek
There's nobody here, it's just you and me
It's where I want to be but I hardly know
This beauty by my side
I'll never forget the way you look tonight

I never will forget the way you look tonight

The lady in red, my lady in red
I love you"

95,Michael Jackson,Thriller,1984,"It's close to midnight and something evil's lurking in the dark
Under the moonlight you see a sight that almost stops your heart
You try to scream but terror takes the sound before you make it
You start to freeze as horror looks you right between the eyes
You're paralyzed

'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
And no one's gonna save you from the beast about to strike
You know it's thriller, thriller a' night
You're fighting for your life inside a killer, thriller tonight

You hear the door slam and realize there's nowhere left to run
You feel the cold hand and wonder if you'll ever see the sun
You close your eyes and hope that this is just imagination, girl
But all the while you hear a creature creepin' up behind
You're out of time

â€~Cause this is thriller, thriller night
There ain't no second chance against the thing with forty eyes girl
Thriller, thriller night
You're fighting for your life inside of killer, thriller tonight

Night creatures call
And the dead start to walk in their masquerade
There's no escapin' the jaws of the alien this time
(They're open wide)
This is the end of your life

They're out to get you, there's demons close to the inn on every side
They will possess you unless you change that number on your dial
Now is the time for you and I to cuddle close together, yeah
All through the night I'll save you from the terror on the screen

I'll make you see that this is thriller, thriller night
Girl, I can thrill you more than any ghoul would ever dare try
Thriller, thriller night
So let me hold you tight and share a killer, diller, chiller

Darkness falls across the land
The midnight hour is close at hand
Creatures crawl in search of blood
To terrorize y'alls neighborhood

And whosoever shall be found
Without the soul for getting down
Must stand and face the hounds of hell
And rot inside a corpse's shell

I'm gonna be here tonight
I'm gonna be here tonight
I'm gonna be here tonight
I'm gonna be here tonight
Oh darlin' thriller night

The foulest stenches in the air
The funk of forty thousand years
And grizzly ghouls from every tomb
Are closing in to seal your doom

And though you fight to stay alive
Your body starts to shiver
For no mere mortal can resist
The evil of the thriller"

100,Kaoma,Lambada,1989,"Chorando se foi quem um dia so me fez chorar
Chorando se foi quem um dia so me fez chorar

Chorando estara ao lembrar de um amor
Que um dia nao soube cuidar
Chorando estara ao lembrar de um amor
Que um dia nao soube cuidar

A recordacao vai estar com ele aonde for
A recordacao vai estar pra sempre aonde for

Danca sol e mar guardarei no olhar
O amor faz perder encontrar
Lambando estarei ao lembrar que este amor
Por um dia um instante foi rei

A recordacao vai estar com ele aonde for
A recordacao vai estar pra sempre aonde for

Chorando estara ao lembrar de um amor
Que um dia nao soube cuidar

Cancao riso e dor melodia de amor
Um momento que fica no ar

I, I, I
Dancando Lambada"
