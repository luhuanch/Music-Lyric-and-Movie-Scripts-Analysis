1,Sinead O'Connor,Nothing Compares 2 U,1990,"It's been seven hours and fifteen days
Since u took your love away
I go out every night and sleep all day
Since you took your love away
Since you been gone I can do whatever I want
I can see whomever I choose
I can eat my dinner in a fancy restaurant
But nothing
I said nothing can take away these blues

'Cause nothing compares
Nothing compares to you

It's been so lonely without you here
Like a bird without a song
Nothing can stop these lonely tears from falling
Tell me baby where did I go wrong
I could put my arms around every boy I see
But they'd only remind me of you
I went to the doctor and guess what he told me
Guess what he told me
He said girl you better have fun
No matter what you do
But he's a fool

'Cause nothing compares
Nothing compares to you

All the flowers that you planted, mama
In the back yard
All died when you went away
I know that living with you baby was sometimes hard
But I'm willing to give it another try

Nothing compares
Nothing compares to you
Nothing compares
Nothing compares to you
Nothing compares
Nothing compares to you"
2,Celine Dion,My Heart Will Go On,1998,"Ev'ry night in my dreams, I see you, I feel you
That is how I know you go on
Far across the distance and spaces between us
You have come to show you go on

Near, far, wherever you are
I believe that the heart does go on
Once more you open the door and you're
Here in my heart and my heart will go on and on

Love can touch us one time and last for a
Lifetime and never let go till we're gone
Love, was when I loved you, one true time
I had to, in my life we'll always go on

Near, far, wherever you are
I believe that the heart does go on
Once more you open the door and you're
Here in my heart and my heart will go on and on

You're here, there's nothing I fear, and I know
That my heart will go on. We'll stay forever this way
You are safe in my heart and my heart will go on
And on"
3,Bryan Adams,(Everything I Do) I Do it For You,1991,"Look into my eyes, you will see

I can't live a normal life, I was raised by the stripes

and my homies is down so don't arouse my anger, fool
death ain't nothing but a heartbeat away
I'm living life, do or die, what can I say
I'm 23 now, but will I live to see 24

7,Cher,Believe,1998,"After love After love After love After love
After love After love After love After love
No matter how hard I try
You keep pushing me aside
And I can't break through
There's no talking to you
It's so sad that you're leaving
It takes time to believe it

But after all is said and done
You're gonna be the lonely one, oh
Do you believe in life after love
I can feel something inside me says
I really don't think you're strong enough, now
Do you believe in life after love

I can feel something inside me says
I really don't think you're strong enough, now
What am I supposed to do
Sit around and wait for you
Well I can't do that
And there's no turning back
I need time to move on
I need a love to feel strong

'Cause I've got time to think it through
And maybe I'm too good for you, oh
Do you believe in life after love
I can feel something inside me says
I really don't think you're strong enough, now
Do you believe in life after love

I can feel something inside me says
I really don't think you're strong enough, now
Well I know that I'll get through this
'Cause I know that I am strong

I don't need you anymore, oh

I don't need you anymore
No I don't need you anymore

8,P Diddy & Faith Evans,I'll Be Missing You,1997,"Yeah, this right here
Goes out to everyone
That has lost
Someone or that
Truly loved
Check it out

Seems like yesterday
We used
To rock the show
I laced the track
You locked the flow
So far from hangin' on
The block for dough
Notorius
They got to know that
Life ain't always
What it seem to be
Words can't express
What you mean to me
Even though you're gone
We still a team
Thru your family
I'll fulfill your dreams
In the future can't wait
To see if you'll open up
The gates for me
Reminisce
Sometime the night
They took my friend
Try to black it out
But it plays again
When it's real feelings
Hard to conceal
Can't imagine
All the pain I feel
Give anything to hear
Half your breath
I know you still livin'
Your life after death

Every step I take
Every move I make
Every single day
Everytime I pray
I'll be missing you
Thinking of the day
When you went away
What a life to take
What a bond to break
I'll be missing you

(We miss you, Big)

It's kinda hard
Wit you not around
Know you in heaven
Smilin' down
Watching us
While
We pray for you
Everyday
We pray for you
Till the day
We meet again
In my heart is where
I keep you friend
Memories
Give me the strength
I need to proceed
Strength
I need to believe
My thoughts, Big
I just can't define
Wish I could turn back
The hands of time
Us and the six shop
For new clothes
And kicks
You and me
Takin' flics
Makin' hits
Stages
They receive you on
Still can't believe
You're gone
Give anything to hear
Half your breath
I know you still livin'
Your life after death

Somebody tell me why

One black morning
When this life is over
I know
I'll see your face

Every night I pray
Every step I take
Every move I make
Every single day
Every night I pray
Every step I take
Every move I make
Every single day
Every night I pray
Every step I take
Every move I make
Every single day
Every night I pray
Every step I take
Every move I make
Every single day

Every night I pray
Every step I take
Every move I make
Every single day

Every night I pray
Every step I take
Every move I make
Every single day

i was bruised and battered and i couldn't tell
What i felt
I was unrecognizable to myself
I saw my reflection in a window i didn't know
My own face
Oh brother are you gonna leave me
Wastin´away
On the streets of philadelphia

I walked the avenue till my legs felt like stone
I heard the voices of friends vanished and gone
At night i could hear the blood in my veins
Black and whispering as the rain
On the streets of philadelphia

Ain't no angel gonna greet me
It's just you and i my friend
My clothes don't fit me no more
I walked a thousand miles
Just to slip the skin

The night has fallen, i'm lyin'awake
I can feel myself fading away
So receive me brother with your faithless kiss
Or will we leave each other alone like this
On the streets of philadelphia"

I heard he sang a good song, I heard he had a style.
And so I came to see him and lip sing for a while.
And there he was this young boy, a stranger to my eyes.

Strumming my pain with his fingers,
(one time, one time)
singing my life with his words,
(two time, two time)
killing me softly with his song,
killing me softly with his song,
telling my whole life with his words,
killing me softly with his song

I felt all flushed with fever, embarrassed by the crowd,
I felt he found my letters and read each one out loud.
I prayed that he would finish but he just kept right on.

Strumming my pain with his fingers,
(one time, one time)
singing my life with his words,
(two time, two time)
killing me softly with his song,
killing me softly with his song,
telling my whole life with his words,
killing me softly with his song

Strumming my pain with his fingers,
(yes he was)
singing my life with his words,
killing me softly with his song,

Do you know somebody named?

Oh you know his name
Oh yeah definitely I know his name
Well I just want to let you that he's mine

Think it's time we got this straight
Sit and talk face to face
There is no way you could mistake
Him for your man are you insane?

But see I know that you may be
Just a bit jealous of me
But you're blind if you can't see
That his love is all in me

See I tried to hesitate
I didn't want to say what he told me
He said without me he couldn't make it
Through the day, ain't that a shame?

But maybe you misunderstood
'Cause I can't see how he could
Wanna change something that's so good
All my love was all it took

You keep on acting like a fool
You need to know it's me not you
And if you didn't know it's 'cause it's true

I think that you should realize
And try to understand why
He is a part of my life
I know it's killing you inside

You can say what you wanna say
What we have you can't take
From the truth you can't escape
I can tell the real from the fake

When will you get the picture
You're the past I'm the future
Get away it's my time to shine
If you didn't know the boy is mine

You need to give it up, had about enough

You need to give it up, had about enough
It's not hard to see the boy is mine
I'm sorry that you seem to be confused

You can't destroy this love I've found
Your silly games I won't allow
The boy is mine without a doubt
You might as well throw in the towel

What makes you think that he wants you
When I'm the one that brought him to
The special place that's in my heart
He was my love right from the start

You need to give it up, had about enough
It's not hard to see the boy is mine
I'm sorry that you seem to be confused
He belongs to me, the boy is mine

You're my reason for reason
The step in my groove
And if you say this life ain't good enough
I would give my world to lift you up
I could change my life to better suit your mood
Cause you're so smooth

And it's just like the ocean under the moon
Well that's the same as the emotion that I get from you
You got the kind of lovin that can be so smooth
Give me your heart, make it real
Or else forget about it
I'll tell you one thing
If you would leave it would be a crying shame
In every breath and every word I hear your name calling me out
Out from the barrio, you hear my rhythm from your radio
You feel the turning of the world so soft and slow
Turning you round and round

And these are the days that never end
And some nights you're breathing fire

And some nights you're carved in ice
Some nights you're like nothing I've ever seen before

Or will again
And maybe I'm crazy

Oh it's crazy and it's true
I know you can save me

No one else can save me now but you
As long as the planets are turning
As long as the stars are burning
As long as your dreams are coming true
You better believe it

That I would do anything for love
I'll be there till the final act
And I would do anything for love!
And I'll take the vow and seal a pact

But I'll never forgive myself if we don't go all the way

And somedays I pray for silence
And somedays I pray for soul
Somedays I just pray to the God of Sex and Drums and Rock 'N Roll.

And some nights I lose the feeling
And some nights I lose control
Some nights I just lose it all when I watch you dance and the thunder rolls
And maybe I'm lonely
That's all I'm qualified to be

There's just one and only
The one and only promise I can keep
As long as the wheels are turning
As long as the fires burning

As long as your prayers are coming true
You better believe it

That I would do anything for love
And you know it's true and that's a fact

And I would do anything for love
And there'll never be no turning back
But I'll never do it better then I do it with you

Will you raise me up?
Will you help me down?
Will you get me right out of this Godforsaken town?
Will you make it all a little less cold?
I can do that!
Oh I can do that!
Will you hold me sacred?
Will you hold me tight?
Can you colorize my life I'm so sick of black and white?
Can you make it all a little less old?
I can do that
Oh oh now i can do that
Will you make me some magic with your own two hands?
Can you build an emerald city with these grains of sand?
Can you give me something I can take home?
Now I can do that
Oh now I can do that
Will you cater to every fantasy I got?
Will you hose me down with holy water, if I get too hot! (HOT)?
Will you take me places I've never known?
Now I can do that
Oh, oh now I can do that!
After a while to forget everything
It was a brief interlude and a midsummer night's fling
And you'll see that its time to move on
I won't do that
I won't do that
I know the territory
I've been around
It'll all turn to dust
And we'll all fall down
And sooner or later you'll be screwing around
I won't do that!
No, I won't do that!

Oh I would do anything for love
I would do anything for love

Then I flow like a harpoon daily and nightly 
Will it ever stop? Yo -- I don't know 
Turn off the lights and I'll glow 
To the extreme I rock a mic like a vandal 
Light up a stage and wax a chump like a candle. 

Dance, Bum rush the speaker that booms 
I'm killing your brain like a poisonous mushroom 
Deadly, when I play a dope melody 
Anything less than the best is a felony 
Love it or leave it, You better gain way 
You better hit bull's eye, The kid don't play

With the bass kicked in, the Vegas are pumpin' 
Quick to the point, to the point no faking 
I'm cooking MCs like a pound of bacon 
Burning them if they're not quick and nimble 
I go crazy when I hear a cymbal 
And a hi hat with a souped up tempo 
I'm on a roll and it's time to go solo 
Rollin' in my 5.0 
With my ragtop down so my hair can blow 
The girlies on standby, Waving just to say Hi 
Did you stop? No -- I just drove by 
Kept on pursuing to the next stop 
I busted a left and I'm heading to the next block 
That block was dead 

Yo -- so I continued to A1A Beachfront Ave. 
Girls were hot wearing less than bikinis 
Rockman lovers driving Lamborghinis 
Jealous 'cause I'm out geting mine 
Shay with a gauge and Vanilla with a nine 
Reading for the chumps on the wall 
The chumps acting ill because they're so full of ""Eight Ball"" 
Gunshots ranged out like a bell 
I grabbed my nine -- All I heard were shells 
Falling on the concrete real fast 
Jumped in my car, slammed on the gas 
Bumper to bumper the avenue's packed 
I'm trying to get away before the jackers jack 
Police on the scene, You know what I mean 
They passed me up, confronted all the dope fiends 
If there was a problem, You, I'll solve it 
Check out the hook while my DJ revolves it 

Ice Ice Baby Vanilla, Ice Ice Baby Vanilla 
Ice Ice Baby Vanilla, Ice Ice Baby Vanilla 

Take heed, 'cause I'm a lyrical poet 
Miami's on the scene just in case you didn't know it 
My town, that created all the bass sound 
Enough to shake and kick holes in the ground 
'Cause my style's like a chemical spill 
Feasible rhymes that you can vision and feel 
Conducted and formed, This is a hell of a concept 
We make it hype and you want to step with this 
Shay plays on the fade, slice like a ninja 
Cut like a razor blade so fast, Other DJs say, ""damn"" 
If my rhyme was a drug, I'd sell it by the gram 
Keep my composure when it's time to get loose 
Magnetized by the mic while I kick my juice 
If there was a problem, Yo -- I'll solve it! 
Check out the hook while Deshay revolves it.

So move out of your seat
And get a fly girl and catch this beat
While it's rollin'. Hold on
Pump a little bit and let them know it's going on

Or a tape to learn

Lifted me up when I couldn't reach
You gave me faith 'cause you believed

You touched my hand I could touch the sky
I lost my faith, you gave it back to me
You said no star was out of reach

You stood by me and I stood tall
I had your love, I had it all
I'm grateful for each day you gave me
Maybe I don't know that much
But I know this much is true
I was blessed because I was loved by you

A light in the dark shining your love into my life
You've been my inspiration
Through the lies you were the truth
My world is a better place because of you

48,TLC,Waterfalls,1995,"A lonely mother gazing out of her window
Staring at a son that she just can't touch.
If at any time he's in a jam she'll be by his side
But he doesn't realize he hurts her so much.
But all the praying just ain't helping at all
'Cause he can't seem to keep his self out of trouble.
So, he goes out and he makes his money the best way he know how
Another body laying cold in the gutter.
Listen to me.

Don't go chasing waterfalls.
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to.
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all

But I think you're moving too fast.

Little precious has a natural obsession for temptation
But he just can't see.
She give him loving that his body can't handle
But all he can say is, ""Baby, it's good to me.""
One day he goes and takes a glimpse in the mirror
But he doesn't recognize his own face.
His health is fading and he doesn't know why.

Three letters took him to his final resting place.
Y'all don't hear me.

Don't go chasing waterfalls.

Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to.
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all

I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
But I think you're moving too fast.
I seen rainbow yesterday
But too many storms have come and gone
Leavin' a trace of not on God-given ray
Is it because my life is ten shades of gray
I pray all ten fade away
Seldom praise Him for the sunny days
And like his promise is true
Only my faith can undo
The many chances I blew
To bring my life to anew
Clear blue and unconditional skies
Have dried the tears from my eyes
No more lonely cries
My only bleedin' hope
Is for the folk who can't cope
Wit such an endurin' pain
That it keeps 'em in the pourin' rain
Who's to blame
For tootin' caine in your own vein
What a shame
You shoot and aim for someone else's brain

You claim the insane
And name this day in time
For fallin prey to crime
I say the system got you victim to your own mind

Dreams are hopeless aspirations
In hopes of comin' true
Believe in yourself
The rest is up to me and you

Don't go chasing waterfalls.
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to.
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
But I think you're moving too fast.
Don't go chasing waterfalls.
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to.
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
But I think you're moving too fast."

In the bedroom and all around

Touch me now, I close my eyes
And dream away

It must have been love but it's over now
It must have been good but I lost it somehow
It must have been love but it's over now
From the moment we touched till the time had run out

Make believing we're together
That I'm sheltered by your heart
But in and outside, I turned to water
Like a teardrop in your palm

And it's a hard winter's day
I dream away

It must have been love but it's over now
It was all that I wanted, now, I'm living without
It must have been love but it's over now
It's where the water flows, it's where the wind blows

And I miss you, like the deserts miss the rain
And I miss you, like the deserts miss the rain

Could you be dead?
You always were two steps ahead, of everyone
We'd walk behind while you would run
I look up at your house
And I can almost hear you shout down to me
Where I always used to be

And I miss you, like the deserts miss the rain
And I miss you, like the deserts miss the rain

Back on the train, I ask why did I come again?
Can I confess, I've been hanging round your old address?
And the years have proved
To offer, nothing since you've moved
You're long gone, but I can't move on

And I miss you, like the deserts miss the rain
And I miss you, like the deserts miss the rain
And I miss you

I step off the train
I'm walking down your street again
And past your door, I guess you don't live there anymore
It's years since you've been there
Now you've disappeared somewhere, like outer space
You've found some better place

And I miss you,
And I miss you,
You found some better place

And I miss you, like the deserts miss the rain
And I miss you, yeah, like the deserts miss the rain

When he holds you close, he pulls you near
When he says the words you've been needin' to hear
I wish I was him with these words of mine

That I will love you baby

This ain't no disco
It ain't no country club either
This is L.A.

""All I wanna do is have a little fun before I die""
Says the man next to me out of nowhere
It's apropos of nothing, he says his name is William
But I'm sure he's Bill or Billy or Mac or Buddy

And he's plain ugly to me
And I wonder if he's ever had a day of fun in his whole life
We are drinking beer at noon on Tuesday
In a bar that faces a giant car wash

The good people of the world
Are washing their cars on their lunch break
Hosing and scrubbing as best they can in skirts in suits

They drive their shiny Datsuns and Buicks
Back to the phone company, the record store too
Well they're nothing like Billy and me

'Cause all I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one

All I wanna do is have some fun
Until the sun comes up
Over Santa Monica Boulevard

I like a good beer buzz early in the morning
And Billy likes to peel the labels from his bottles of Bud
He shreds them on the bar then he lights every match
In an oversized pack letting each one burn

Down to his thick fingers before blowing and cursing them out
And he's watching the bottles of Bud
As they spin on the floor

And a happy couple enters the bar
Dangerously close to one another
The bartender looks up from his want ads

But all I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one

All I wanna do is have some fun
Until the sun comes up
Over Santa Monica Boulevard

Otherwise the bar is ours
The day and the night and the car wash, too
The matches and the Buds and the clean and dirty cars
The sun and the moon

But all I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling, I'm not the only one

All I wanna do is have some fun
I've got a feeling the party has just begun
All I wanna do is have some fun
I won't tell you, that you're the only one

This is how it's got to be
First of all I won't take you cheating on me
And who can I trust, if I can't trust in you
And I refuse to let you play me for a fool

You said that we could possibly spend eternity
See that's what you told me, that's what you said
But if you want me
You have to be fulfilling all my dreams
If you really want me baby

If you had my love
And I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me?
And if somehow you knew
That your love would be untrue
Would you lie to me?
And call me baby

You said you want my love
And you've got to have it all
But first there are some things you need to know
If you wanna live with all I have to give
I need to feel true love or it's got to end, yeah

I don't want you tryin' to get with me
And I end up unhappy
I don't need the hurt and I don't need the pain
So before I do, give myself to you
I have to know the truth
If I spend my life with you

If you had my love
And I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me?
And if somehow you knew
That your love would be untrue
Would you lie to me?
And call me baby

If you had my love
And I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me?
And if somehow you knew

Would you lie to me?

Let me see you dance a little
I like it when you dance a little
Baby work it out and just dance a little

Come on and dance a little
Let me see you dance a little
I like it when you dance a little
Darkchild, Jennifer Lopez, come on

If you had my love
And I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me?
And if somehow you knew
That your love would be untrue
Would you lie to me?

71,Natalie Imbruglia,Torn,1998,"I thought, I saw a man brought to life
He was warm, he came around and he was dignified
He showed me what it was to cry

Well, you couldn't be that man I adored
You don't seem to know
Seem to care what your heart is for
But I don't know him anymore

There's nothing where he used to lie
The conversation has run dry
That's what's going on
Nothing's fine, I'm torn

I'm all out of faith
This is how I feel
I'm cold and I am shamed
Lying naked on the floor

Illusion never changed
Into something real
I'm wide awake and I can see
The perfect sky is torn
You're a little late, I'm already torn

So I guess the fortune teller's right
Should have seen just what was there
And not some holy light

It crawled beneath my veins
And now I don't care, I had no luck
I don't miss it all that much
There's just so many things
That I can touch, I'm torn

I'm all out of faith
This is how I feel
I'm cold and I am shamed
Lying naked on the floor

Illusion never changed
Into something real
I'm wide awake and I can see
The perfect sky is torn
You're a little late, I'm already torn, torn

There's nothing where he used to lie
My inspiration has run dry
That's what's going on
Nothing's right, I'm torn

I'm all out of faith
This is how I feel
I'm cold and I am shamed
Lying naked on this floor

Illusion never changed
Into something real
I'm wide awake and I can see
The perfect sky is torn

Choosing my confessions
Trying to keep an eye on you

The hint of the century
Consider this

To my knees failed
What if all these fantasies
Come flailing around
Now I've said too much
I thought that I heard you laughing
I thought that I heard you sing

From the mountains of faith
To a river so deep
I must be looking for something
Something sacred I lost
But the river is wide
And it's too hard to cross

And even though I know the river is wide
I walk down every evening and I stand on the shore
And try to cross to the opposite side
So I can finally find out what I've been looking for

In the middle of the night
I go walking in my sleep
Through the valley of fear
To a river so deep
And I've been searching for something
Taken out of my soul
Something I would never lose
Something somebody stole

I don't know why I go walking at night
But now I'm tired and I don't want to walk anymore
I hope it doesn't take the rest of my life
Until I find what it is that I've been looking for

In the middle of the night
I go walking in my sleep
Through the jungle of doubt
To a river so deep
I know I'm searching for something
Something so undefined
That it can only be seen
By the eyes of the blind
In the middle of the night

I'm not sure about a life after this
God knows I've never been a spiritual man
Baptized by the fire, I wade into the river
That runs to the promised land

In the middle of the night
I go walking in my sleep
Though the desert of truth
To the river so deep
We all end in the ocean
We all start in the streams
We're all carried along
By the river of dreams
In the middle of the night"

And now I'm oh oh so sad
And I don't think he's comin' back, comin' back

I did too much lyin', wasted too much time
Now I'm here an' cryin', I, I, I

Been around the world and I, I, I
I can't find my baby
I don't know when, I don't know why
Why he's gone away
And I don't know where he can be, my baby
But I'm gonna find him

Been around the world and I, I, I
I can't find my baby
I don't know when, I don't know why
Why he's gone away
And I don't know where he can be, my baby
But I'm gonna find him
I'm goin' find him, my baby

I did too much lyin', wasted too much time
Now I'm here an' cryin', I, I and I

Been around the world and I, I, I
I can't find my baby
I don't know when, I don't know why
Why he's gone away
And I don't know where he can be, my baby
But I'm gonna find him

I've been around the world, lookin' for my baby
Been around the world, and I'm gonna
I'm gonna find him

Been around the world and I, I, I
I can't find my baby
I don't know when, I don't know why
Why he's gone away
And I don't know where he can be, my baby
But I'm gonna find him"
