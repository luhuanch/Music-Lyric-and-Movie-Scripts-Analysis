1,The Beatles,Hey Jude,1968,"Hey Jude, don't make it bad
Take a sad song and make it better
Remember to let her into your heart

Then you can start to make it better

Hey Jude, don't be afraid

You were made to go out and get her

The minute you let her under your skin

Then you begin to make it better

And any time you feel the pain

Hey Jude, refrain

Don't carry the world upon your shoulder

For well you know that it's a fool

Who plays it cool
By making his world a little colder
Na na na naa-naa

Hey Jude, don't let me down
You have found her, now go and get her

So let it out and let it in

And don't you know that it's just you
Hey Jude, you'll do

Yeah
Hey, Jude, don't make it bad

2,The Rolling Stones,(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction,1965,"Hey look
I can't get no satisfaction
I can't get no satisfaction
I try and I try and I try and I try
I can't get no, I can't get no

When I'm drivin' in my car
And that man comes on the radio
And he's tellin' me more and more
About some useless information
Supposed to drive my imagination
I can't get no, no no
Hey hey hey, that's what I say

I can't get no satisfaction
I can't get no satisfaction
I try and I try and I try and I try
I can't get no, I can't get no

When I'm watchin' my TV
And a man comes on to tell me
How white my shirts can be
Well he can't be a man 'cause he doesn't smoke
The same cigarettes as me
I can't get no, no no no
Hey hey hey, that's what I say

I can't get no satisfaction
I can't get no girl reaction
I try and I try and I try and I try try try
I can't get no, I can't get no

When I'm ridin' round the world
And I'm doin' this and I'm signing that
And I'm tryin' to make some girl
Who tells me baby better come back later next week
You see I'm on losing streak
I can't get no, no no no
Hey hey hey, that's what I say

3,Procol Harum,A Whiter Shade of Pale,1967,"Procol Harum
Miscellaneous
A Whiter Shade Of Pale
We skipped the light fandango
And turned cartwheels across the floor
I was feeling kind of seasick
The crowd called out for more
The room was humming harder
As the ceiling flew away
Whe we called out for another drink
The waiter brought a tray

And so it was that later
As the miller told his tale
That her face at first just ghostly
Turned a whiter shade of pale

She said there is no reason
And the truth is plain to see
But I wandered through my playing cards
Would not let her be
One of sixteen vestal virgins
Who were leaving for the coast
At the moment my eyes were open
They might just as well have been closed

And so it was that later
As the miller told his tale
That her face at first just ghostly
Turned a whiter shade of pale"
4,The Beatles,I Want to Hold Your Hand,1964,"Oh, yeah, I tell you something
I think you'll understand
When I say that something's
I wanna hold your hand
I wanna hold your hand
I wanna hold your hand

Oh, please say to me
You'll let me be your man
And, please, say to me
You'll let me hold your hand
You'll let me hold your hand
I wanna hold your hand

And when I touch you, I feel happy inside
It's such a feeling that my love
I can't hide

I can't hide
I can't hide
Yeah, you got that something
I think you'll understand
When I say that something's
I wanna hold your hand

I wanna hold your hand
I wanna hold your hand
And when I touch you, I feel happy inside

It's such a feeling that my love
I can't hide
I can't hide

5,Roy Orbison,"Oh, Pretty Woman",1964,"Pretty woman, walkin' down the street
Pretty woman, the kind I'd like to meet
Pretty woman
I don't believe you
You're not the truth
No one can look as good as you
Mercy

Pretty woman, oh won't you pardon me
Pretty woman, I couldn't help but see
Pretty woman

Come to me baby, be mine tonight

Pretty woman, don't walk on by
Pretty woman, don't make me cry
Pretty woman
Don't walk away hey, okay
If that's the way it must be okay

I guess I'll go on home it's late
Maybe tomorrow night but wait
What do I see

Is she walking back to me?
Yeah, she's walking back to me
Oh, pretty woman"
6,Elvis Presley,Are You Lonesome Tonight?,1960,"Are you lonesome tonight? Do you miss me tonight?
Are you sorry we drifted apart?
Does your memory stray to a brighter sunny day?
When I kissed you and called you sweetheart?

Do the chairs in your parlor seem empty and bare?
Do you gaze at your doorstep and picture me there?
Is your heart filled with pain? Shall I come back again?
Tell me dear, are you lonesome tonight

I wonder if you're lonesome tonight
You know someone said that the world's a stage
And each must play a part
Fate had me playing in love with you as my sweet heart

Act one was when we met, I loved you at first glance
You read your line so cleverly and never missed a cue
Then came act two, you seemed to change, you acted strange
And why? I've never known

Honey, you lied when you said you loved me
And I had no cause to doubt you
But I'd rather go on hearing your lies
Than I go on living without you

Now the stage is bare and I'm standing there
With emptiness all around
And if you won't come back to me
Then they can bring the curtain down

Is your heart filled with pain? Shall I come back again?
Tell me dear, are you lonesome tonight"
7,Elvis Presley,It's Now Or Never,1960,"It's now or never, come hold me tight
Kiss me my darling, be mine tonight
Tomorrow will be too late
It's now or never, my love won't wait

When I first saw you with your smile so tender
My heart was captured, my soul surrendered
I'd spend a lifetime, waiting for the right time
Now that you're near, the time is here at last

It's now or never, come hold me tight
Kiss me my darling, be mine tonight
Tomorrow will be too late
It's now or never, my love won't wait

Just like a willow, we would cry an ocean
If we lost true love and sweet devotion
Your lips excite me, let your arms invite me
For who knows when we'll meet again this way

It's now or never, come hold me tight
Kiss me my darling, be mine tonight
Tomorrow will be too late
It's now or never, my love won't wait

It's now or never, my love won't wait
It's now or never, my love won't wait
It's now or never, my love won't wait"
8,The Monkees,I'm a Believer,1967,"I thought love was only true in fairytales
Meant for someone else but not for me
Love was out to get me
That's the way it seemed
Disappointment haunted all my dreams

Then I saw her face, now I'm a believer
Not a trace of doubt in my mind
I'm in love, I'm a believer
I couldn't leave her if I tried

I thought love was more or less a givin' thing
Seems the more I gave the less I got
What's the use in trying?
All you get is pain
When I needed sunshine I got rain

Then I saw her face, now I'm a believer
Not a trace of doubt in my mind
I'm in love, I'm a believer
I couldn't leave her if I tried

Love was out to get me
Now that's the way it seemed
Disappointment haunted all my dreams

Not a trace of doubt in my mind

9,The Beatles,Help!,1965,"Help, I need somebody
Help, not just anybody
Help, you know I need someone
Help!

When I was younger, so much younger than today
I never needed anybody's help in any way
But now these days are gone I'm not so self-assured
Now I find I've changed my mind and opened up the doors

Help me if you can, I'm feeling down
And I do appreciate you being 'round
Help me get my feet back on the ground
Won't you please, please help me?

And now my life has changed in oh so many ways
My independence seems to vanish in the haze
But every now and then I feel so insecure
I know that I just need you like I've never done before

Help me if you can, I'm feeling down
And I do appreciate you being 'round
Help me get my feet back on the ground
Won't you please, please help me?

11,Frank Sinatra,Strangers in the Night,1966,"Strangers in the night exchanging glances
Wondering in the night what were the chances
We'd be sharing love before the night is through

Something in your eyes was so inviting
Something in your smile was so exciting
Something in my heart told me I must have you

Strangers in the night
Two lonely people, we were strangers in the night
Up to the moment when we said our first hello
Little did we know, love was just a glance away
A warm embracing dance away and

Ever since that night we've been together
Lovers at first sight, in love forever
It turned out so right for strangers in the night
Two strangers in the night"

There are no gloomy skies
When seen through the eyes
Of those who are blessed with love

And the sweet secret of
A summer place
Is that it's anywhere

When two people share
All their hopes, all their dreams
All their love

In your arms, in your arms
In your arms, in your arms"

Seems to help I know downtown.

Linger on the sidewalk where the neon signs are pretty
How can you lose?

The lights are much brighter there
you can forget all your troubles, forget all your cares
so go downtown
Things will be great when you're downtown
No finer place for sure downtown
Everything's waiting for you.

Don't hang around and let your problems surround you
There are movie shows downtown.
Maybe you know some little places to go to
where they never close downtown.

Just listen to the rhythm of a gentle bossa nova

You'll be dancing with 'em too before the night is over

happy again.
The lights are much brighter there
you can forget all your troubles, forget all your cares
so go - downtown
Where all the lights are bright downtown
waiting for you tonight downtown
you're gonna be alright now
downtown
downtown

downtown
And you may find somebody kind to help and understand you
Someone who is just like you and needs a gentle hand to

guide them along.
So maybe I'll see you there
we can forget all our troubles, forget all our cares
so go downtown
Things will be great when you're downtown

don't wait a minute more downtown
Everything is waiting for you

She is anyway

29,Mary Hopkin,Those Were the Days,1968,"Once upon a time there was a tavern
Where we used to raise a glass or two.
Remember how we laughed away the hours
And thinking of all the great things we would do.

Those were the days, my friend,
We thought they'd never end,
We'd sing and dance forever and a day;
We'd live the life we choose we'd fight and never lose
For we were young and sure to have our way.

La la la la la la,
La la la la la la,
La la la la la la la la la la.

Then the busy years went rushing by us,
We lost our starry notions on the way.
If by chance I'd see you in the tavern,
We'd smile at one another and we'd say.

Those were the days, my friend,
We thought they'd never end,
We'd sing and dance forever and a day;
We'd live the life we choose we'd fight and never lose
Those were the days, oh yes, those were the days.

La la la la la la,
La la la la la la,
La la la la la la la la la la.

Just tonight I stood before the tavern,
Nothing seemed the way it used to be.
In the glass I saw a strange reflection,
Was that lonely woman really me?

Those were the days, my friend,
We thought they'd never end,
We'd sing and dance forever and a day;
We'd live the life we choose we'd fight and never lose
Those were the days, oh yes, those were the days.

La la la la la la,
La la la la la la,
La la la la la la la la la la.
La la la la la la,
La la la la la la,
La la la la la la la la la la.

Through the door there came familiar laughter,
I saw your face and heard you call my name.
Oh my friend we're older but no wiser,
For in our hearts the dreams are still the same.

Those were the days, my friend,
We thought they'd never end,
We'd sing and dance forever and a day;

I've come to talk with you again
Because a vision softly creeping
Left its seeds while I was sleeping
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains within the sound of silence

In restless dreams, I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone
'Neath the halo of a street lamp
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night and touched the sound of silence

And in the naked light, I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking
People hearing without listening
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare disturb the sound of silence

""Fools"" said I, you do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words, that I might teach you
Take my arms, that I might reach you
But my words like silent raindrops fell
And echoed in the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon God they made
And the sign flashed out its warning
In the words that it was forming
And the sign said, ""The words of the Prophets
Are written on the subway walls and tenement halls""
And whispered in the sounds of silence"

Everything still remains the same
I can't do what ten people tell me to do
So I guess I'll remain the same, listen

Sittin' here resting my bones
And this loneliness won't leave me alone, listen
2000 miles I've roamed
Just to make this dock my home

Now I'm just gonna sit at the dock of the bay
Watching the tide roll away

I look inside myself and see my heart is black.
I see my red door and must have it painted black.
Maybe then I'll fade away and not have to face the facts
It's not easy facin' up when your whole world is black.

My love will laugh with me before the mornin' comes.

70,Nancy Sinatra,Somethin' Stupid,1967,"I know I stand in line until you think
You have the time to spend an evening with me
And if we go someplace to dance
I know that there's a chance you won't be leaving with me
And afterwards we drop into a quiet little place
And have a drink or two...
And then I go and spoil it all by saying
Something stupid like I love you

I can see it in your eyes that you despise
The same old lines you heard the night before...
And though it's just a line to you for me it's true...
And never seemed so right before
I practice everyday to find some clever lines
To say to make the meaning come true...
But then I think I'll wait until the evening gets late
And I'm alone with you
The time is right your perfume fills my head...
The stars get red and on the nights so blue...
And then I go and spoil it all by saying
Something stupid like I love you

Workin' for the man every night and day

Worryin' 'bout the way things might have been

Big wheel keep on turnin'

Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river

Cleaned a lot of plates in Memphis
Pumped a lot of pain down in New Orleans
But I never saw the good side of the city

Bet you gonna find some people who live
You don't have to worry 'cause you have no money

72,Bobby Goldsboro,Honey,1968,"See the tree, how big it's grown
But friend, it hasn't been too long it wasn't big
I laughed at her and she got mad
The first day that she planted it was just a twig

Then the first snow came and she ran
Out to brush the snow away so it wouldn't die
Came runnin' in all excited
Slipped and almost hurt herself, I laughed 'til I cried

She was always young at heart
Kind a dumb and kind a smart and I loved her so
I surprised her with a puppy
Kept me up all Christmas Eve two years ago

And it would sure embarrass her when
I came home from working late 'cause I would know
That she'd been sittin' there cryin'
Over some sad and silly late, late show

And honey, I miss you and I'm being good
And I'd love to be with you if only I could
She wrecked the car and she was sad
And so afraid that I'd be mad but what the heck

Though I pretended hard to be
Guess you could say, she saw through me and hugged my neck
I came home unexpectedly
And found her crying needlessly in middle of the day

And it was in the early spring
When flowers bloom and Robin's sing, she went away
And honey, I miss you and I'm being good
And I'd love to be with you if only I could

Yes, one day while I wasn't home
While she was there and all alone, the angels came
Now all I have is memories of honey
And I wake up nights and call her name

Now my life's an empty stage
Where honey lived and honey played and love grew up
A small cloud passes over head
And cries down in the flower bed that honey loved

See the tree, how big it's grown"

78,Bob Dylan,Like a Rolling Stone,1965,"Once upon a time you dressed so fine
Threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
People call, say, ""Beware doll you're bound to fall""
You thought they were all kiddin' you

You used to laugh about everybody that was hangin' out
Now you don't talk so loud
Now you don't seem so proud
About having to be scrounging your next meal

How does it feel?
How does it feel?
To be without a home
Like a complete unknown
Like a rolling stone

You've gone to the finest school, all right Miss Lonely
But you know you only used to get juiced in it
Nobody's ever taught you how to live out on the street
And now you're gonna have to get used to it

You said you'd never compromise with the mystery tramp
But now you realize, he's not selling any alibis
As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes
And say, ""Do you want to make a deal?""

How does it feel?
How does it feel?
To be on your own
With no direction home
A complete unknown
Like a rolling stone

You never turned around to see the frowns
On the jugglers and the clowns when they all did tricks for you
Never understood that it ain't no good
You shouldn't let other people get your kicks for you

You used to ride on the chrome horse with your diplomat
Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat
Ain't it hard when you discover that he really wasn't where it's at?
After he took from you everything he could steal

How does it feel?
How does it feel?
To be on your own
With no direction home
Like a complete unknown
Like a rolling stone

Princess on the steeple and all the pretty people
They're all drinkin', thinkin' that they got it made
Exchanging all precious gifts
But you better take your diamond ring, you better pawn it babe

You used to be so amused at Napoleon in rags
And the language that he used, go to him now he calls you
You can't refuse, when you got nothing, you got nothing to lose
You're invisible now, you got no secrets to conceal

How does it feel?
How does it feel?
To be on your own
With no direction home

Just what the truth is, I can't say any more

'Cause, I love you
Yes, I love you
Oh, how I love you, oh

'Cause, I love you
Yes, I love you
Oh, how I love you, oh
I love you, oh"
93,Ricky Nelson,Hello Mary Lou,1961,"Hello Mary Lou, goodbye heart
Sweet Mary Lou, I'm so in love with you
I knew Mary Lou, we'd never part
So hello Mary Lou, goodbye heart

You passed me by one sunny day
Flashed those big brown eyes my way
And oo I wanted you forever more
Now I'm not one that gets around
Swear my feet stuck to the ground
And though I never did meet you before

I said, hello Mary Lou, goodbye heart
Sweet Mary Lou, I'm so in love with you
I knew Mary Lou, we'd never part
So hello Mary Lou, goodbye heart

I saw your lips I heard your voice
Believe me I just had no choice
Wild horses couldn't make me stay away
I thought about a moonlit night
My arms about good an' tight
That's all I had to see for me to say

Hey, hey, hello Mary Lou, goodbye heart
Sweet Mary Lou, I'm so in love with you
I knew Mary Lou, we'd never part
So hello Mary Lou, goodbye heart
So hello Mary Lou, goodbye heart
Yes hello Mary Lou, goodbye heart"
94,The Beatles,We Can Work it Out,1966,"We Can Work It Out
Try to see it my way,
Do I have to keep on talking till I can't go on?
While you see it your way,
Run the risk of knowing that our love may soon be gone
We can work it out,
We can work it out

Think of what you're saying
You can get it wrong and still you think that it's alright
Think of what I'm saying,
We can work it out and get it straight, or say good night
We can work it out,
We can work it out

Life is very short, and there's no time
For fussing and fighting, my friend
I have always thought that it's a crime,
So I will ask you once again
Try to see it my way,
Only time will tell if I am right or I am wrong
While you see it your way
There's a chance that we may fall apart before too long
We can work it out,
We can work it out

Life is very short, and there's no time

Baby don't leave me
Ooh, please don't leave me
All by myself

I've got this burning, burning, yearning
Feelin' inside me
Ooh, deep inside me
And it hurts so bad

You came into my heart
So tenderly
With a burning love
That stings like a bee

Now that I surrender
So helplessly
You now wanna leave
Ooh, you wanna leave me

Ooh, baby, baby
Where did our love go?
Ooh, don't you want me
Don't you want me no more? Ooh, baby

Baby, baby
Where did our love go?
And all your promises
I'll love ya ever more

I've got this burning, burning, yearning
Feelin' inside me
Ooh, deep inside me
And it hurts so bad

Before you won my heart
You were a perfect guy
And I'll let you guide me
You wanna leave me behind

Baby, don't leave me
Ooh, please don't leave me
All by myself

97,Percy Sledge,When a Man Loves a Woman,1966,"When a man loves a woman 
Can't keep his mind on nothing else 
He'll change the world
For the good thing he's found 
If she's bad he can't see it 
He can do her no wrong
Turn his back on his best friend 
If he put her down 

When a man loves a woman 
Spend his very last dime 
Tryin' to hold on to what he needs 
He'd give up all his comfort 
Sleep out in the rain 
If she said that's the way it ought to be

Well, this man loves a woman 
I gave you everything I had 
Trying to hold on to your high-class love
Baby, please don't treat me bad 

When a man loves a woman 
Down deep in his soul 
She can bring him such misery 
If she plays him for a fool 
He's the last one to know 
Lovin' eyes can't ever see 

When a man loves a woman 
He can do no wrong 
He can never want some other girl
Yes when a man loves a woman 
I know exactly how he feels 
'Cause baby, baby, baby, you're my world

Miscellaneous
Puppet On A String
                I wonder if one day that, you'll say that, you care
If you say you love me madly, I'll gladly, be there
Like a puppet on a string

Love is just like a merry-go-round
With all the fun in the air
One day I'm feeling down on the ground
Then I'm up in the air
Are you leading me on?
Tomorrow will you be gone?

I wonder if one day that, you'll say that, you care
If you love me madly, I'll gladly, be there
Like a puppet on a string

I may win on the roundabout
Then I'll lose on the swings
In or out, there is never a doubt
Just who's pulling the strings
I'm all tied up to you
But where's it leading me to?

I wonder if one day that, you'll say that, you care
If you say you love me madly, I'll gladly, be there
Like a puppet on a string

I wonder if one day that, you'll say that, you care
If you say you love me madly, I'll gladly, be there

100,Creedence Clearwater Revival,Bad Moon Rising,1969,"I see the bad moon arising
I see trouble on the way
I see earthquakes and lightnin'
I see bad times today

Don't go around tonight
Well, it's bound to take your life
There's a bad moon on the rise

I hear hurricanes blowing
I know the end is coming soon
I fear rivers over flowing
I hear the voice of raze and ruin

Don't go around tonight
Well, it's bound to take your life
There's a bad moon on the rise

All right

Hope you got your things together
Hope you are quite prepared to die
Looks like we're in for nasty weather
One eye is taken for an eye

Don't go around tonight
Well, it's bound to take your life
There's a bad moon on the rise
Don't go around tonight
Well, it's bound to take your life
There's a bad moon on the rise"
